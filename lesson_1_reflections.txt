it was little bit difficult to read and understand

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could easily lookback how i evolved into the solution.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pro- u are simply master
cons- if u miss out commiting it may lead to problem


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
it saves memory for docs and 
saving everything though no change is made is useless


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to view all the commits
git diff to view the changes made
b/w commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
i am free now and can change whateverway i like it


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
create a project
